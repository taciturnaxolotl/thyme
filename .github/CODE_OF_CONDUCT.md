# Code Of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is based heavily on "instruments of good works" from chapter 4 of The Rule of St. Benedict (hereafter: "The Rule"). This Rule has proven its mettle in thousands of diverse communities for over 1,500 years, and has served as a baseline for many civil law codes since the time of Charlemagne.

The Rule is strict, and none are able to comply perfectly. Grace is readily granted for minor transgressions. All are encourage to follow this rule closely, as in so doing they may expect to live happier, healthier, and more productive lives. The entire Rule is good and wholesome, and yet we make no enforcement of the more introspective aspects.

We view The Rule as our promise to all users of this project of how the developers are expected to behave. This is a one-way promise, or covenant. In other words, the developers are saying: "We will treat you this way regardless of how you treat us." We ask you to join us in this covenant through your interactions with this project.
