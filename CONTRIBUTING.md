# Contributing.md

Hi there! I'm glad you decided to add something! I don't have a super strict contributing guideline but here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Please try to follow the existing style of code and documentation. I know this seems kinda obvious but its easy enough to forget when implementing a new feature!
2. Follow the CoC please ðŸ’– It should be linked on this repo's home page but if not you can find it [here](https://github.com/taciturnaxolotl/carriage/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The TLDR is be nice and don't be a jerk but then again so is the TLDR of most CoCs :)
3. Use conventional commits! I'm a big fan of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. It makes it easier to track changes and generate changelogs. I tend to use it at a pretty basic level (feat|chore|bug|docs: <message>) but feel free to get as fancy as you want within the standard ^-^
4. Last one. Once you open a PR ping me plz ðŸ˜„ I tend to forget to check my repos for PRs so a ping will remind me it exists and i'll get to it much quicker! Alternatively you can open the PR and wait 4-6 business months ðŸ’€
